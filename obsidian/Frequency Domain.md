The image after a [[Fourier Transform]] with dimensions: $H \times W \times 2$.
Also known as "kspace". In kspace we have a complex matrix ($H \times W$ of complex numbers), and we can divide it to 2 channels that we call the "frequency domain" ($H \times W \times 2$ of real numbers).

Images in this domain are denoted by $\tilde x \in \tilde {\mathcal X}$.
