In MRI imaging, multiple coils are often used to capture data, each producing its own image. To unify these images into one comprehensive picture, we use the Root Sum of Squares (RSS) technique. By employing RSS, for each pixel, the values from each coil are squared, summed, and then the square root is taken. The result is a single, combined image that consolidates the information from all coils.
