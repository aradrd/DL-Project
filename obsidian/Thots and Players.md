Using generative models our noising process will be the subsampling (whose mask can also be learned), and our denoising process will hopefully reconstruct the original image as best as possible (somehow subsampling can be undone by small [[Gaussian]] denoising steps).
Models that we've seen in the course and might be effective for our task:
- CNN (vanilla)
- VAE
- Diffusion
We can gather more models from:
- Papers
- Ofek
	- [ ] Set meeting
- Doda (maybe)
